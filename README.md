Xiaomi Yi Configurator (XYC)
==========================
[Â© Tawbaware software, 2015](http://www.tawbaware.com)

This script runs inside the Xiaomi Yi camera and allows the user to enable RAW file creation, and change photographic options such as exposure, ISO, whitebalance, etc. It is designed to be executed and accessed via a telnet client running on any phone, computer, tablet, etc.

# Installation

1. Install script at top level of SD card and ensure execute permissions:    
`chmod 755 /tmp/fuse_d/xyc.sh`   
2. Optional.  If you have custom settings (e.g. bitrate, video size, etc.)
   that you want to be included in the autoexec.ash file, store these commands
   in a  file named autoexec.xyc in the same directory as xyc.sh.  Also, using
   XYC, set the "Custom Photo Settings" ->  "Import additional settings..."
   menu choice to "yes".  XYC will copy everything from the autoexec.xyc into
   autoexec.ash whenever it updates autoexec.ash.
3. Optional.  If you want XYC to operate in a language other than English,
   create a file named xyc_strings.sh in the same directory as xyc.sh.  See
   "TRANSLATION STRINGS" section below.
4. Optional. If you want RAW Time Lapse than enable Create RAW camera setting, 
   save settings and go to official Xiaomi YiCam app -> Photo Time-lapse. 
   Also you can use other camera settings to configure Time-lapse footage. 

# Usage

1. Enable wifi, and connect to camera using telnet
   (IP=192.168.42.1, user id="root", no password)
